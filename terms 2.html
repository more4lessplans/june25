      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated: March 23, 2025</strong></p>
      <p>Welcome to More4Less Plans. These Terms of Service govern your use of our services, including account management, customer support, and equipment leasing for third-party internet access. By subscribing to our services or using this website, you agree to be bound by these terms, as well as any additional policies referenced herein, including our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use our services.</p>
      <p>The More4Less Plans Group is based in Ontario, Canada. We are not an internet service provider (ISP). Instead, we provide account management and support services for third-party internet services, along with leasing advanced equipment to ensure seamless connectivity for our customers.</p>

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <p>For clarity, the following terms are used throughout this agreement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer</strong>: Refers to the individual or entity subscribing to our services. This includes you, the user, whether you are an individual or representing a business or organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Service</strong>: Encompasses the account management, billing support, technical assistance, and customer service we provide to facilitate your access to third-party internet services. This does not include the provision of internet connectivity itself, which is supplied by third-party ISPs.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment</strong>: Includes any hardware we provide for use with the service, such as routers, modems, or other connectivity devices. All equipment is leased to you and remains our property.</li>
        <li><strong>Agreement</strong>: Refers to these Terms of Service, along with our Privacy Policy and any other policies or notices referenced herein.</li>
        <li><strong>We/Us/Our</strong>: Refers to More4Less Plans, the business operating this website and providing the services described.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Service Overview</h2>
      <p>More4Less Plans offers a subscription-based service designed to simplify your internet experience. We manage customer accounts, handle billing, provide technical support, and lease advanced equipment to ensure reliable connectivity with third-party internet services. Our role is to act as an intermediary, helping you navigate and optimize your internet service while providing high-quality equipment to enhance your experience.</p>
      <p>Our service operates on a month-to-month basis, meaning there are no long-term contracts or commitments required. You may cancel at any time, subject to the termination terms outlined below. We charge a monthly fee for our services, which includes the cost of leasing the equipment and accessing our support resources. This fee does not include the cost of the third-party internet service, which you are responsible for obtaining and maintaining separately.</p>
      <p>We aim to provide a seamless and hassle-free experience, but we do not guarantee the performance, availability, or reliability of the third-party internet services you use in conjunction with our service. Any issues related to internet connectivity, speed, or outages should be addressed with your ISP, though we will assist in troubleshooting and coordinating support where possible.</p>

      <h2>Equipment Lease Terms</h2>
      <p>As part of our service, we lease equipment to you, such as routers or modems, to ensure optimal performance with your third-party internet service. The following terms govern the use, maintenance, and return of this equipment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ownership</strong>: All equipment provided by us remains the sole property of More4Less Plans. You are granted a non-transferable, non-exclusive right to use the equipment during the term of your active subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>Condition and Use</strong>: You agree to use the equipment solely for its intended purpose and in accordance with any instructions or guidelines we provide. The equipment must be used exclusively with the third-party internet service we recommend, as using it with other services may result in compatibility issues or damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance and Care</strong>: You are responsible for keeping the equipment in good working condition, protecting it from damage beyond normal wear and tear. Normal wear and tear includes minor scratches or cosmetic imperfections that do not affect functionality. Damage beyond normal wear and tear includes, but is not limited to, water damage, cracked components, or modifications to the equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Return of Equipment</strong>: Upon cancellation or termination of your subscription, you must return all leased equipment to us within 30 days. The equipment must be returned in good working condition, with all original components, cables, and packaging included. We will provide you with a return shipping label or instructions for returning the equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Return Shipping Costs</strong>: You may be responsible for the cost of return shipping, which will be charged to your account if applicable. We recommend using a trackable shipping method to ensure the equipment is received, as we are not liable for items lost or damaged during return shipping.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Return Fees</strong>: If you fail to return the equipment within 30 days of cancellation, or if the equipment is returned in a damaged or non-functional state (beyond normal wear and tear), we reserve the right to charge a non-return fee. This fee will be equal to the replacement cost of the equipment, as determined by us, and will be added to your account for payment.</li>
        <li><strong>Lost or Stolen Equipment</strong>: If the equipment is lost or stolen during your subscription, you must notify us immediately. You may be responsible for the replacement cost of the equipment, which will be charged to your account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Billing and Payments</h2>
      <p>Our service operates on a prepaid, month-to-month billing cycle. The following terms outline our billing and payment policies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Payment Schedule</strong>: Payment for the service is due in advance, either every 30 days or every month, depending on your plan type. Your subscription fee will be charged on the same recurring schedule based on your initial subscription date. For example, if you subscribed on the 5th of the month, your payment will be due on the 5th of each subsequent month. Billing information can be found in the customer portal.</li>
        <li><strong>Accepted Payment Methods</strong>: We accept payments via credit card, debit card, or other approved methods as specified during the checkout process. You agree to provide accurate and up-to-date payment information to ensure uninterrupted service.</li>
        <li><strong>Additional Charges</strong>: In addition to the monthly subscription fee, you may be charged for non-return fees, damage fees, return shipping costs, or other applicable charges as outlined in this agreement. These charges will be added to your account and are due immediately upon being incurred.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Failures</strong>: If a payment attempt fails (e.g., due to an expired card or insufficient funds), we will notify you and attempt to charge the payment method on file again. You are responsible for maintaining updated payment information to avoid service interruptions. If payment remains outstanding after 7 days, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your service.</li>
        <li><strong>Taxes</strong>: All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes, including the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) in Ontario. You are responsible for paying any taxes associated with your subscription, which will be added to your invoice as required by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Late Fees</strong>: If payment is not received within 7 days of the due date, we may charge a late fee of 2% per month (24% per annum) on the outstanding balance, or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is lower.</li>
        <li><strong>Disputes</strong>: If you believe there is an error in your billing, you must notify us within 30 days of the charge. We will investigate and resolve the issue promptly. Failure to notify us within this timeframe may result in the charge being deemed valid.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Service Usage</h2>
      <p>Our service is designed for personal use by individual customers. The following terms govern how you may use the service and equipment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Permitted Use</strong>: The service and leased equipment are intended for personal, non-commercial use only. You may not resell, sublicense, or otherwise distribute the service or equipment to third parties without our prior written consent. Commercial use, such as using the service for a business or enterprise, requires a separate agreement with us.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommended Internet Service</strong>: You agree to use the leased equipment exclusively with the third-party internet service we recommend. Using the equipment with other services may result in compatibility issues, reduced performance, or damage to the equipment, for which you will be responsible.</li>
        <li><strong>Prohibited Activities</strong>: You agree not to use the service or equipment for any unlawful, fraudulent, or abusive purposes, including but not limited to violating intellectual property rights, transmitting malware, or engaging in activities that interfere with the third-party internet service or our operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: We reserve the right to monitor your use of the service and equipment to ensure compliance with these terms. This may include tracking usage patterns or investigating reports of misuse. We will handle any personal information collected during monitoring in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Service Termination</h2>
      <p>We aim to provide a flexible and customer-friendly service. The following terms outline the process for terminating your subscription:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer-Initiated Termination</strong>: You may cancel your subscription at any time by contacting our support team via email or phone. A minimum of 10 days’ notice is required to process your cancellation and avoid being charged for the next billing cycle. For example, if your billing date is the 5th of the month and you provide notice on the 25th, you will not be charged for the following month.</li>
        <li><strong>Our Right to Terminate</strong>: We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your service at our discretion, with or without notice, for reasons including but not limited to:
          <ul>
            <li>Non-payment of fees after 7 days of the due date.</li>
            <li>Breach of these terms, such as misuse of the service or equipment.</li>
            <li>Fraudulent activity or suspected illegal use of the service.</li>
            <li>Any other reason we deem necessary to protect our business, customers, or third-party partners.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Post-Termination Obligations</strong>: Upon termination, you must return all leased equipment within 30 days, as outlined in the Equipment Lease Terms section. Failure to return the equipment will result in a non-return fee. Any outstanding fees, including subscription fees, late fees, or equipment-related charges, remain due and payable after termination.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="returns">Refunds and Returns</h2>
      <p>We strive to ensure customer satisfaction, but our refund and return policies are limited due to the nature of our service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Fees</strong>: All prepaid service fees are non-refundable, even if you cancel mid-cycle. For example, if you cancel 10 days into your billing cycle, you will not receive a refund for the remaining 20 days of that month.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment Returns</strong>: Returned equipment must be in new or gently used condition, with all original components, cables, and packaging included. We reserve the right to inspect the equipment upon return and charge for any damage beyond normal wear and tear.</li>
        <li><strong>Return Shipping</strong>: You are responsible for the cost of return shipping unless otherwise specified. We recommend using a trackable shipping method, as we are not liable for items lost or damaged during return shipping.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Returnable Items</strong>: Equipment that is damaged beyond repair, missing components, or not in its original packaging may not be accepted for return, and you may be charged a non-return fee.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To initiate a return, please visit our returns portal:</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the following terms limit our liability for issues arising from your use of the service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Internet Services</strong>: We are not an ISP and do not control the performance, availability, or reliability of the third-party internet services you use in conjunction with our service. We are not liable for any service interruptions, outages, speed issues, or data loss caused by your ISP or other third-party providers.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment Issues</strong>: While we provide high-quality equipment, we are not liable for any damages, data loss, or service interruptions caused by equipment malfunctions, defects, or compatibility issues, except as required by law (e.g., implied warranties under the Consumer Protection Act, 2002).</li>
        <li><strong>Indirect Damages</strong>: We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or business opportunities, arising from your use of the service or equipment, even if we were advised of the possibility of such damages.</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum Liability</strong>: Our total liability to you for any claim arising from this agreement, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the total amount of fees paid by you to us in the 3 months preceding the claim.</li>
        <li><strong>Use at Your Own Risk</strong>: You agree to use the service and equipment at your own risk. We make no warranties, express or implied, regarding the service or equipment, except as required by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Warranties and Consumer Rights</h2>
      <p>We provide the following warranties and protections in accordance with Canadian law:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Implied Warranties</strong>: Under the Consumer Protection Act, 2002 (Ontario), certain implied warranties apply to our service and equipment, such as the warranty that the equipment is of acceptable quality and fit for its intended purpose. These warranties cannot be excluded and apply notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment Warranty</strong>: We warrant that the leased equipment will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for the duration of your subscription. If the equipment fails due to a defect, we will repair or replace it at no cost to you, provided the failure is not due to misuse, damage, or unauthorized modifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer Rights</strong>: Nothing in this agreement limits or excludes your rights as a consumer under applicable Canadian laws, including the Consumer Protection Act, 2002, and the Competition Act. If any provision of this agreement is found to be unenforceable, it will be severed, and the remaining provisions will remain in effect.</li>
      </ul>

We collect and use your personal information solely for the purposes of account management, billing, customer support, and improving our services.

      <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time to reflect changes in our business practices, legal requirements, or industry standards. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by email (using the email address associated with your account) or by posting a notice on this website at least 30 days before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the service after the effective date of the changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms. If you do not agree with the changes, you may cancel your subscription before the changes take effect.</p>

      <h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>This agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from this agreement will be resolved as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Informal Resolution</strong>: We encourage you to contact us first to resolve any issues informally. You can reach us using the contact details below, and we will work with you in good faith to address your concerns.</li>
        <li><strong>Mediation</strong>: If the issue cannot be resolved informally, both parties agree to attempt mediation in Ontario before pursuing legal action. The costs of mediation will be shared equally unless otherwise agreed.</li>
        <li><strong>Jurisdiction</strong>: If mediation fails, any legal action must be brought in the courts of Ontario, and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of these courts.</li>
      </ul>
